# Are you an active developer?

The aim of this package is to get some useful stats from a local `git` repo.

## To run it

All code uses Standard Library so far so you should be able to run it upon checkout:

```
python3 -m stats YOUR_REPO_FOLDER
```

## Example output

Bit meta but here is how it looks for this repo at this time of writing:

```
$ python3 -m stats ~/code/git-stats
